He also brings up comments by some ministers, including Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, which suggest that getting a university degree is not the only option. By discouraging young people from getting a degree, he says, they could miss the window of opportunity when the economy changes , and when PAP changes its mind.Wrapping up his speech, he urges residents to vote for him. "I don't want to be just an MP, I want to be that spark, that catalyst that brings out the best in the people of Bukit Batok." He adds: "Vote for the candidate who serves you not just with words but action... vote for the candidate who can work for you full-time." ST PHOTO/VIDEO: WALTER SIM21:25Happening now: SDP rally at Bukit Gombak stadiumDr Chee Soon Juan rebuts comments made by PM Lee Hsien Loong and PAP ministers about him and the SDP. He says he wants to put a stop to gutter politics, and focus on issues that matter to residents.On PM Lee, he says: "Up until tonight, I have never brought up the issue of what his sister said about him." He adds: "I had ample opportunity to attack him on this but I did not. It would have been very potent because it's not a political opponent saying it, it's your own flesh and blood making these statements about this." He asks the crowd: "If it were my sister saying such things about me, do you think the PAP will not go to town with this?"On PAP MP Grace Fu, Dr Chee says she tried to paint the SDP as racist. He challenges the public to find and produce statements by SDP that are remotely racist. On the contrary, it's the PAP MPs who had made controversial comments on this issue, he points out.He also addresses a point raised by PAP MP Halimah Yacob at Friday's rally. She had recounted the incident when Dr Chee shouted remarks at then-prime minister Goh Chok Tong when they met at a hawker centre in the run-up to the 2001 general election. She had said that it was "one of the most shocking experiences" because "whatever party we're from, we must respect our prime minister".Responding to that, Dr Chee says while we say we should respect elders, it is ironic that "we make elderly wipe tables and clean toilets".20:32Happening now: SDP rally at Bukit Gombak stadiumSDP's vice-chairman John Tan, addressing doubts cast on Dr Chee's character, says "you can't judge someone's character accurately simply by having some public perception of the person". Ms Jaslyn Go, who contested Yuhua SMC in GE2015, hits out at PAP MP Grace Fu's comments on Dr Chee's work experience, calling the remarks "disparaging" to stay-at-home mothers and grandparents who take care of their families without pay. Mr Bryan Lim, who was part of the SDP team for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC in GE2015, assures Bukit Batok residents that the Home Improvement Programme will proceed as planned even if PAP is not elected.SDP's Paul Tambyah, meanwhile, responds to PM Lee Hsien Loong's comment that anyone standing for public office should be prepared to have his past actions examined. Dr Tambyah says: "We welcome the opportunity to examine all assets of PAP MPs."19:56Police to take action against organisers of peaceful May Day rally in Kuala LumpurThe rally ended without incident, but the authorities said they will be taking action against its organisers. http://str.sg/44Tx PHOTO: EPA 19:27Happening now: SDP rally at Bukit Gombak stadium This is SDP's second rally. Dr Chee Soon Juan has said he will address Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's criticism of him at the rally. ST's Walter Sim and Ong Wee Jin will bring you the latest from the rally. First speaker of the night is SDP member Jufri Salim, followed by Mr Damanhuri Abas who responded to questions raised by PAP about Dr Chee. "They say he is jobless. No! He is a political writer by profession... They tell you he kicked Chiam See Tong out of SDP. No! Chiam resigned!" he says.Speaking next, Mr Sadasivam Veriyah, who contested Bukit Batok at GE2015, describes Dr Chee as a "wonderful character", and claims that the PAP is trying to tarnish Dr Chee's reputation because "they are afraid of him". PAP is "afraid", he says, because it's a single seat. "Over the next four, five days, the whole Cabinet will be down to encourage you to vote for Murali." ST PHOTOS: WALTER SIM, ALPHONSUS CHERN18:25Bukit Batok by-election: Heng Swee Keat criticises SDP's Paul Tambyah on issue of characterIn a Facebook post, the Finance Minister noted that Dr Tambyah had said "a person is not defined by his or her actions or words", and claimed that character "doesn't matter". http://str.sg/44TY PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO "This has to be one of the most astounding statements ever made in the history of Singapore politics.
