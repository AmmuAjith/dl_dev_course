The Government needs to be able to respond to the mood, but not go too far and 'capsize the boat'," he notes. "Our nation, like a ship, needs an optimal amount of ballast â€“ enough to keep us stable, but not so much as to render us sluggish and unresponsive to change," he adds. "Our Presidency has always served as our maritime flag, a symbol of our identity at sea." http://str.sg/4gpF18:01Happening now: Debate in Parliament on Elected Presidency changes DPM Teo now moves on to the revised entrenchment framework.
