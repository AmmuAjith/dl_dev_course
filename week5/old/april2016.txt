The town council also confirmed that it fully accepts all conditions set by MND in relation to the grants.This is the full MND statement:MND will be disbursing the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) operating grants for FY 2014/15 and FY 2015/161 to Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) and Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council (PRPTC).In its Judgment dated 27 November 2015, the Court of Appeal (CA) made various orders against AHPETC to compel its compliance with the Town Councils Act (TCA) and Town Councils Financial Rules (TCFR). This included an order that AHPETC must appoint independent accountant(s) to assist in identifying its outstanding non-compliances with Section 35(c) of the TCA, advise it on appropriate remedial steps to be taken, and establish whether any past payments made by AHPETC were improper and ought therefore to be recovered.The CA orders would see that the Town Council takes steps to rectify its outstanding non-compliances of the TCA and TCFR with the assistance of its appointed accountant(s). The Minister for National Development has hence decided, pursuant to Section 42 of the TCA, to disburse the grants to AHTC, subject to conditions. These include AHTC appointing accountant(s) as required under the CA Judgment, setting up segregated bank accounts to receive the grants and getting the accountant(s) to co-authorise and co-sign large payments out of these accounts.AHTC has since appointed KPMG LLP as its accountant and confirmed that it fully accepts all conditions set by MND in relation to the grants. With these safeguards in place, MND will be disbursing the grants to AHTC. Following the 2015 General Election, all assets, rights and liabilities pertaining to Punggol East SMC have been transferred from AHTC to PRPTC with effect from 1 Dec 2015. This legal position is set out in the Town Councils (Declaration of Towns) Order 2015. Accordingly, the operating grants attributable to Punggol East SMC will be disbursed to PRPTC.MND had earlier withheld the grants from AHPETC in view of the many weaknesses and lapses in AHPETC identified by its own auditors and the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) report dated 6 February 2015.Load morePowered by 24liveblog

Preliminary investigations indicate that the 22kV circuit breakers at Buona  Vista station tripped. "As  the Buona Vista power intake station supplies power to the western sector of the  North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) and parts of the Circle Line (CCL), this  affected train services on the NSEWL from Buona Vista to Joo Koon and Jurong  East to Kranji, and CCL from Harbourfront to Caldecott. As the Bukit Panjang LRT  system receives power from the same source through Choa Chu Kang on the NSEWL,  it was similarly affected.  "Checks  carried out during engineering hours indicated that the circuit breaker trip was  not due to a power dip, but a power fault within the western sector of the  NSEWL. More checks will be carried out after train operations end today.â€�   20:52For Singapore's system to work, good politics and good policies must go together: PM LeeGood politics and good policies must go together for Singapore's system to work, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at a dinner for senior civil servants on Tuesday (April 26). http://str.sg/4ZDS   20:48Civil servants not independent of elected Government, but they should be politically impartial: PM Lee The civil service is not independent of the elected government, unlike the judiciary, which is a different branch of government, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. http://str.sg/4ZDo 20:09Football: Inquest finds that 96 Liverpool fans were 'unlawfully killed' at Hillsborough tragedyThe 96 Liverpool fans who died in Britain's 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster were unlawfully killed, a jury found on Tuesday, following the longest-running inquest in English legal history. http://str.sg/4ZRV PHOTO: EPA 19:52Singapore Swimming Club wins appeal to get back $1.5m from former presidentIn a twist to a long-running saga, the Singapore Swimming Club on Tuesday won an appeal to get back $1.5 million in club funds that former president Freddie Koh used to defend a defamation suit against him. http://str.sg/4ZRj PHOTO: ST FILELoad morePowered by 24liveblog

Describing Mr Ong as a "good guy", he says: "I don't want to do that, it's not my style. You don't want to kick a man when he is down."He also calls Mr Murali "a decent chap" and says he has heard good things about him. "My criticism is not about him as a person but his political views." He adds that he has told SDP members not to launch personal attacks against Mr Murali because "he is Singaporean first, PAP member second".Wrapping up his speech, he urges residents to vote for him: "Now is the time to bring your dreams, your hope, your concerns and worries with me to Parliament... we may not get another chance like this." ST VIDEOS: DELPHINE KAO, SAMUEL MAK21:39Happening now: Chee Soon Juan speaks at the SDP rally for Bukit Batok by-electionDr Chee says residents are paying high S&CC fees because PAP MPs outsourced the running of the estate to profit-making companies. But as a full-time MP if elected, he will be personally overseeing the running of the estate to avoid adding to cost. Referring to Mr Murali's comment that it is possible to juggle both work and his duty as an MP, Dr Chee says: "If you want to personally oversee estate... and tend to the needs of resident, there is absolutely no way you can be a part-time MP."He has a proposition for Mr Murali who has said that a team approach - not just a single MP - is needed to address the needs of residents: Why not fulfil his duty as an MP in the day time and work as a lawyer at night since he is also not a one-man show at his law firm?He adds that the SDP will be accountable to residents by consulting them on issues, such as how town council funds will be used and invested. ST VIDEOS: DELPHINE KAO, SAMUEL MAK21:26Happening now: Minister Grace Fu raises questions about Dr Chee Soon Juan's promise to be a full-time MPCulture, Community and Youth Minister Grace Fu asks if Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) has the experience of running a town council. She worries that the SDP does not "understand the complexity" of running a town council. She also says that SDP chief Dr Chee Soon Juan will not be giving up a full-time job to be a full-time MP. "Work experience or the lack of, is a relevant fact for a candidate," she says. To recruit a person, you need to look at their work experience and references from those who worked with them, she says."It will be very interesting to see if there will be a reference letter from Mr Chiam See Tong, the 'sifu' (master) who recruited Mr Chee into the SDP," she said.Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob is the last to speak. She told residents to vote for Mr Murali as he is an "old boy" and not a "new kid on the block". Mr Murali has been a grassroots volunteer for 16 years and was the former PAP branch secretary in Bukit Batok. Madam Halimah says that Mr Murali was the man who "held the PAP branch together" when former Bukit Batok MP Dr Ong Chit Chung died in 2008.Of Dr Chee Soon Juan's promise that he will head to Bukit Batok first every morning, she said: "You go to Bukit Batok, you stand there for 24 hours, but you may not achieve anything."In closing, she said that Mr Murali "will be that connector; he will be that catalyst; he will be that link" for the ward.21:12British pair charged with giving money to Brussels, Paris attacks suspectBriton Mohammed Ali Ahmed, 26, and Belgian citizen Zakaria Boufassil,
