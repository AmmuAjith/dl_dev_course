Football: Napoli striker Milik out for ‘months’
WARSAW (AFP) – Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik will be out for several months after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in Poland’s World Cup qualifying victory over Denmark. Following an MRI scan, Napoli issued a statement confirming Milik had suffered a “total rupture” during the 3-2 win in Warsaw on Saturday. He will likely go under the knife on Monday and is expected to be absent from the pitch for four to six months.  The Polish federation had earlier taken to Twitter to announce that Milik would likely need surgery and “be out for several months”. Milik, 22, joined Napoli in August from Ajax and has made a huge impact at the Serie A club.  After two rounds of the Champions League for Napoli he is joint top scorer on three goals alongside Lionel Messi (Barcelona), Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) and Edinson Cavani (Paris Saint Germain).
